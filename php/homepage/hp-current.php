					<p class="profile-bio">Sarah Bichan is a reasonably recent addition to The Sarah Bichan Guild, joining in June via an arranged marriage to James Bichan.</p>

<p>Although her initial transition into Sarah Bichanhood has not been straightforward (the mispronunciation of ‘Bichan’ can, at times, be discouraging,) Sarah has shown the trademark resilience common to Sarah Bichans world wide. </p>

Sarah is known to Guild members as being the token fit one and is fondly called ‘Sarah Bichan the Second.’ Although the wider Bichan public struggle with her non-hate of cats,Sarah has won them over with her good looks and charm.</p>
